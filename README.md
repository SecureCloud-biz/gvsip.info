Google Voice SIP Information
============================

On the Google Voice Product Forum, Google representatives [announced that they "will finish migrating the last of \[their\] XMPP interop capabilities for Google Voice to the new \[SIP-based\] Voice platform"](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/voice/NYRy5U31o98) starting on June 18, 2018. The confusing wording of the statement makes it unclear exactly what will happen on June 18, but one possibility is that the XMPP interop will be shut off at that time.

This site documents how to connect to Google Voice using SIP.

Technical Details
-----------------
### SIP RFCs
Google Voice uses these standards extending what is commonly implemented in a SIP UAC.

* [RFC 5626](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5626) (SIP Outbound) - the single registrar/UA model, CR/LF keepalives 
* [RFC 3608](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3608) (Service Routes)
* [RFC 3325](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3325), the section on P-Preferred-Identity header, which you get from the P-Associated-URI headers in the REGISTER reply. (The URI here is assigned by Google and is a Base 32-encoded concatenation of the username you register and a 20-digit ID associated with your account. You don't need to encode or decode this; just use it in the P-Preferred-Identity header.)
* [draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-authn-02](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sipcore-sip-authn-02), Third-Party Authentication for Session Initiation Protocol, section 3: Authentication using the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow

### Media requirements
#### ICE
On the media side, GV requires the client to present a full ICE implementation. 

#### RTCP
Google Voice implements rtcp-mux ([RFC 5761](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5761)).

#### Codecs
* G.711Âµ
* Opus

Example Flow
------------

### Registration & establishing the TLS socket
#### Request
```http
REGISTER sip:obihai.sip.google.com SIP/2.0
Contact: <sip:me@example.com;transport=tls>;obn=identifier
Expires: 3600
To: <sip:me@obihai.sip.google.com>
Call-ID: ...
Via: SIP/2.0/TLS 10.10.10.10:38250;alias;rport;branch=...
From: <sip:me@obihai.sip.google.com>;tag=...
CSeq: 1 REGISTER
Max-Forwards: 70
Allow: ACK, INVITE, BYE, CANCEL, REGISTER, REFER, OPTIONS, PRACK, INFO
Supported: outbound, path
Authorization: Bearer username="me",realm="obihai.sip.google.com",token="an access token"
Content-Length: 0
```
#### Success Response
```http
SIP/2.0 200 OK
Via: SIP/2.0/TLS 10.10.10.10:38250;rport=38250;branch=...;received=...;alias
Service-Route: <sip:ENCODED-ROUTE:5060;uri-econt=ENCODED-ROUTE-PART-2;lr>
Service-Route: <sip:SECOND-ENCODED-ROUTE:5060;transport=udp;lr;uri-econt=PART-2>
Require: outbound
Contact: <sip:me@10.10.10.10:38250;transport=tls>;obn=identifier;expires=...
To: <sip:me@obihai.sip.google.com>;tag=...
From: <sip:me@obihai.sip.google.com>;tag=...
Call-ID: ...
CSeq: 1 REGISTER
Allow: ACK, BYE, CANCEL, INFO, INVITE, NOTIFY, OPTIONS, PRACK, REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, UPDATE
P-Associated-URI: <sip:BASE-32-ENCODED-URI@obihai.sip.google.com>
P-Associated-URI: <sip:me@obihai.sip.google.com>
Content-Length: 0
```

Store the Service-Routes and the encoded P-Associated-URI. These are used later when establishing a dialog. Service-Routes become `Route:` headers (maintain the same order) and the encoded P-Associated-URI is used for the `P-Preferred-Identity:` header.

Outbound calls are placed over the established socket.

### INVITE
#### Request
```http
INVITE sip:18005551212@obihai.sip.google.com SIP/2.0
Route: <sip:ENCODED-ROUTE:5060;uri-econt=ENCODED-ROUTE-PART-2;lr>
Route: <sip:SECOND-ENCODED-ROUTE:5060;transport=udp;lr;uri-econt=PART-2>
P-Preferred-Identity: <sip:BASE-32-ENCODED-URI@obihai.sip.google.com>
Max-Forwards: 19
Via: SIP/2.0/TLS 10.10.10.10:38250;alias;rport;branch=...
From: <sip:me@example.com>;tag=...
To: <sip:18005551212@obihai.sip.google.com>
Call-ID: ...
CSeq: 2 INVITE
Contact: <sip:me@10.10.10.10:38250;transport=TLS>
Allow: ACK, INVITE, BYE, CANCEL, REGISTER, REFER, OPTIONS, PRACK, INFO
Supported: outbound, path, replaces, 100rel
Content-Type: application/sdp
Content-Length: ...

(sdp)
```

#### Responses
```http
SIP/2.0 100 Trying
...
```

```http
SIP/2.0 183 Session Progress
...
(sdp)
```

The 183 response will include an SDP and Google Voice will start sending early media.

There may be a `180 Ringing` response after this. If so, the endpoint should locally play ringback tone to the caller (differs from common practice defined in [RFC 3960](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3960)).

```http
SIP/2.0 200 OK
...
(sdp)
```

The provisional responses and the 200 OK will contain `Record-Route:` headers which are used for in-dialog routing.
